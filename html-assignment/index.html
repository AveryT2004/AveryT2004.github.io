                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> I am 19 years old, my birthday is February 3<sup>rd</sup> and I am from Orillia, Ontario.<br>
                    When I am not in class learning the arts of photography, web design, digital<br>
                    graphics, design and more, I am spending my free time creating characters and stories.<br>
                    I also play video games and occasionally draw.<br>
                    My current favourite game is <em>The Sims 4</em> on my PC. </p>

                    <p>
                    My most recent personal project has been creating my own Pok√©mon region<br>
                    based on Canada with the help of <abbr title="Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer">ChatGPT</abbr>.<br>
                    My regions name is Canorha, a mix between Canada and north.<br>
                    The other night I was up until 4am discussing ideas for the region with ChatGPT.<br>
                    I am really excited to see how it will turn out!
                    </p>
